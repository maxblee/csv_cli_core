# csv_cli_core
Basic error handling, delimiter parsing, and column selection for CSVs in Rust

## Basic CSV Command-line interface utilities
This crate is a mostly unaltered adaptation of two modules I created for a command-line library
I built to [create pivot tables](https://github.com/maxblee/clipivot). 

I'm hoping to continue using it in future CSV CLIs I build (assuming I do build future CLIs for reading CSVs).

## Installation
To use this library, type this into your `Cargo.toml` file:
```toml
csv_cli_core = { git = "https://github.com/maxblee/csv_cli_core" , tag = "v0.1.0" }
```
